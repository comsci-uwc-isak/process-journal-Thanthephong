The pace of the lesson is quite fast but I still managed to catch up with. Although sometimes the homework can be quite difficult but I always love to do it, and it is much more enjoyable to do comparing to other subjects' homework. Here are the codes and lines that I have taken notes of:

Computer Science L2 notes:
Terminal
Who
Pwd: Path of working directory
cd: Change directory
ls: List files
cd ..  : go up / go back
cd ~ : go al the way up
cd ~/Documents: go to documents no matter where cd is
mkdir ( Make directory ) : creating folder

echo “Hello world” > myname.txt: Send text to the file
echo “ smth” > smth.txt
echo -n “smth” : the next echo will be on the same line
echo -e “Smth”: the \ and “ “ will be deleted


Move folder: mv “file” “to”

mv ~/email.txt ~/Documents/Comsci

ifconfig: finding IP address
 ( inet 192.168.10.99 netmask 0xfffffc00 broadcast 192.168.11.255)

Calculate:
#!/bin/bash ( Start of the program always have this ) 
((sum=25+36))
echo $sum

OR

((age=355*15))
echo $age
