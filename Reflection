Computer science was actually the most interesting class on that first day;
Instead of sitting and listening to theory, what we will be learning, test, work, we did a really fun activity;
It felt nice just walking into the classroom because there were really "chill" music;
Its definitely the best first class experience comparing to other subjects I had: Enlish, Physics,...;
Thank you! I hope this year Computer Science will be an amazing subject;
